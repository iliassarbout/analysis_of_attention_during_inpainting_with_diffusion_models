This repository code is based on [RePaint](https://github.com/andreas128/RePaint), [improved diffusion](ttps://github.com/vedantroy/improved-ddpm-pytorch) and [guided diffusion](https://github.com/openai/guided-diffusion) repositories. In this personal project I analyze object generation through the reverse diffusion process at fixed timesteps checkpoints. We also analyze attention patterns and its spatial biases within the image. 

The report_pdf.df file offer an exhaustive review of my work and explains in details all of my experiments.
